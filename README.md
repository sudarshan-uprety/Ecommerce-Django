Welcome to my Django e-commerce project! This project is an online shopping website built using Django framework. The frontend of the website is built using templates from external sources and the backend has been entirely developed by me.

To run this project on your local machine, please follow the steps given below:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the command: git clone <repository url>

Navigate to the project directory using the command: cd <project directory>

Create a new file called .env in the project directory (This is optional but I do suggest to use venv)

Install the project dependencies using the command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the project using the command: python manage.py runserver

Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the website.

That's it! You should now be able to run this Django e-commerce project on your local machine. 
If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact me
